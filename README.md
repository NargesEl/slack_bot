# slack_bot

I built a ETL pipeline that collected tweets written by Ines Montani and stored them in a postgres database. I then analyzed the sentiment of the tweets and stored the annoted tweets in a second database on MongoDB. Finally, I connected it to my Slack and posted a tweet every few minutes.
